# TiddlyRoam

## Description

TiddlyRoam is your open source external brain.

TiddlyRoam allows you to quickly create your own wiki. You can add fragments of thoughts and findings whenever they come to you. TiddlyRoam will link them and help you spot the patterns.

The project aims to provide a free and open source alternative to the popular [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/).

## Features

TiddlyRoam is a [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) with bi-directional links and graph maps.

### Bi-directional links

This means when you are on page 'Example Page', you can see not just all the pages that 'Example Page' links *to*, but also all pages that link to *it*. This leads to what Roam calls 'networked thought'. It really is something that you need to experience to appreciate.


### Graph maps

This helps you visualise all the pages you have made and how they link together.
